//Separation of concerns is important.
//This app.js file is usually used for middleware declarations / Express set up

//1) MIDDLEWARES

//We want to use only morgean during development. So it will only run while we are on our development envornment.

//Without this we cannot serve files that are in the public folder. HTM, img etc we would need this if we had handlebarsl..

//2) ROUTE HANDLERS

//3) ROUTES

//This is actually a middleware so to be able to use it we must we must app.use
//First we define the route and then call the middleware tourRoutes as callback function

//THIS IS WHERE WE MOUNT OUR ROUTERS

app.use('/api/v1/users', userRouter)
